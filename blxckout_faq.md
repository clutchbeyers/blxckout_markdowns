FAQ: Project and Mint
------------------------------------------
**What is Blxckout setting out to do?**
```The aim has always been to provide products or services that bring more wallets into the ecosystem and make Solana more useful for everyone. Synx is the first product that we hope to release soon. Development is underway for both an iOS application and web application - this is being funded entirely from existing royalties. ```

**What is Synx?**
```Blockchain based ‘private cloud’ storage accessible via mobile phone with a web2 native customer experience, think iCloud built on top of the Solana tech stack. We handle as much of the key management as possible and storage quantities will be available via in-application subscription model. ```

**Why Synx?**
```Estimated that over 1 billion people globally use an iPhone and that number is up 6% over the last year. Solana has placed importance on mobile and we believe providing an easy UX to blockchain based storage on these platforms will continue to bring more data on to the blockchain and make Solana more useful.```

**Wen Synx?**
```This product will take as long as it takes to build, we are talking in weeks terms not months for development of this product. We are not in a rush and we hope to provide holders with as much value as possible. If anyone asks ‘wen’ in chat everyday I ask the mod team to ignore the request. The next time you will hear from the team will be product launch. We are taking an approach much similar to our mentors and friends in the space Genesis Go.```

**How much was mint and why so cheap?**
```Mint was 0.10SOL; After our first mint didn't go to plan with the Oracle solution, we decided to refund those that minted and then release the art as a degen for a cost of 0.10SOL```

**Is this more than an art collection?**
``` We have decided to go with utility back to our holders. Blxckout team is now building the first product called Synx(https://twitter.com/synx_xyz) behind the scenes of the ecosystem based on what the community feels Solana needs at that time. We are taking a builders (one code block at a time) approach with our community holders assisting in beta and QA testing for that valuable feedback loop; all while bringing value and incentives back to our holders based on the success of those services.```

**Where is the roadmap or whitepaper?**
```We will not be putting out a roadmap or whitepaper for the foreseeable future, instead we will launch products and rely on iterative feedback loops from our NFT holders and testers. Check #announcements for the most up to date details of our status and progress```

FAQ: Collection Details
------------------------------------------
**Are there multiple collections of Blxckout?**
```The first generation Blxckouts are a collection of 5555 generated art NFTs that have attributes directly relating to mainstream media events or scandals. On August 4,2022 it was announced that ***possibly*** a second generation of 1111 Blxckouts would be released (at a later date to be announced) as an airdrop to holders of the first generation for the first product in development Synx.```

**Why would you release another generation of Blxckouts?**
```For Synx, revenue share with significant benefits of a 5555 collection may be too large to make profitable from existing royalties. We are most likely going to do a 1111 (subject to small changes) secondary collection which will only be airdropped to Blxckout first generation holders at a 1-5 ratio. Those that hold 5 Blxckout first generation NFTs will get 1 of the new collection of that particular service/product line of the Blxckout ecosystem. So without making promises, there could be a third, fourth collection...and so on. Most all of it dictated and decided upon by our holder community. We are developing together. Enjoy the fruits of our labor```

FAQ: Collection Incentives/Royalties
------------------------------------------
**Does rarity matter?**
```No, all Blxckouts are pretty much treated equal.```

**Any Blxckout attributes get you additional perks or membership?**
```The only trait to date that has more utility is the Gold Gas Mask (Mouth trait) which grants you access to the #ggmg-x-whaled chat in discord and left-over disbursement of the future collection airdrops from whatever is left of the 1111 that didn't have a set of 5. So if there are 115 holders with 4 or less of the first generation Blxckouts, then that is 115 airdrops to be sequentially sent to each gold mask (at random sequences per collection). There may be fun inclusion things we do for certain traits from time to time. But nothing has been decided beyond the Gold Gas Mask for now.```

**What are the incentives and holder perks for first generation versus future generations?**
```While second generation collections and onward receive that particular services revenue share, it is the Genesis Blxckout that is the key to any future collections and will grow over time with its airdrop ability. Blxckout first generation NFTs will always retain value but may see more volume spikes as future products are launched and is thre only NFT you can stake for $BLXCK tokens that will have much use in the future (more to come after we release Synx). We won’t create another collection paid for in SOL unless we have justification to raise a good amount of funds for an ambitious product and or roadmap which would be put to a community vote for input.```

**Is there any point in owning anything less than 5 of the first generation Blaxckouts if you can't get the airdrops?**
```Of course there is extreme value in holding just one first generation Blxckout. It is the key to any future collections and will grow in value over time with its airdrop ability as more services of the ecosystem are rolled out. It is also the only collection that you can stake for the $BLXCK token that will have incentives and rewards for having it. That is to be announced later. There is also always the potential of the first generation NFTs to be allowed WL in the future for any paid SOL collections if we chose that route for raising more funds to get more ambitious with a product. And do not forget, you can always get the revenue share collection of the service of your choice on the secondary market. First generations are the gateway to everything that is Blxckout ;)```

FAQ: Staking and $BLXCK Token
---------------------------------------
**Where do we stake Blxckout NFTs?**
``https://blxck-flip.floppylabs.io/```

**How many $BLXCK tokens do we earn per Blaxckout NFT staked?**
``1 $BLXCK per NFT per day```

**What is the function of BLXCK token?**
``There has been no details yet released of the token, the team is concentrating on getting the first product out to market before proceeding with how the BLXCK token will be leveraged in the ecosystem. It will have desirable utility and value for holders, we just do not want to commit to those details yet. It is wise to stake as soon as you can :)```

**How much does it cost to stake and why floppylabs.io?**
``The current staking platform floppylabs charges .01 per NFT you want to stake/unstake. While that seems expensive, it was an easy staking mechanism to get setup for a degen mint. Will most likely transition to our own built staking platform but that will only be after Synx release to market.```

**I'm having issues staking?**
``First check that you have enough SOL in your wallet to cover the staking/unstaking fees of .01 per Blxckout. Second, if you are having difficulty staking on a ledger just keep trying, it eventually will work. We have seen this behavior. We get that it is not ideal.```

**Any rarity multipliers for staking rewards?**
``No, every Blxckout NFT first generation gets 1 $BLXCK token per day whether you are #1 ranked or #5555 ranked.```

**I have half Blxckout NFTs on my phantom wallet (unstaked) and 3 staked; will I be eligible for the airdrop still to meet the 5 per?**
``Yes, whether you are staking or not, they will both count towards that airdrop requirement.``

------------------------------------------
FAQ: Roles and Whale Status
------------------------------------------
**What do you use for holder role and verification and where do we do this?**
```We use a tool called Metahelix, check the #holder-verify discord channel for more details```

**I had staked my NFT but my holder role was lost. My role was reinstated after I unstaked it. What is the reason?**
```You just needed to reverify with Metahelix if you’d staked as we’re using custodial staking (not ideal but we set it up for original degen mint).```

**How many for the whale role?**
```50 or more Blxckouts of the first generation (5555 in total)```
